        Welcome to the curated list of the most classic Linux interview
        questions. These questions have been carefully selected to help
        you ace your next interview and prepare you for a role involving
        Linux. Our list is divided into three categories based on
        difficulty:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginner Collection</strong> - Covers basic Linux commands, file systems, and general OS concepts.</li><br/>
        <li><strong>Intermediate Collection</strong> - Includes more advanced topics like process management, memory management, and system configuration.</li><br/>
        <li><strong>Advanced Collection</strong> - Contains challenging questions on performance tuning, networking, kernel modules, and debugging techniques.</li><br/>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Interview Collection</strong> - Contains challenging questions on performance tuning, networking, kernel modules, and debugging techniques.</li><br/>
        <li><strong>Cheat Sheet Collection</strong> - Contains key commands and quick tips for Linux professionals.</li><br/>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Similar to mastering any skill, preparing for a Linux-related tech
        interview can be significantly enhanced through deliberate
        practice. The more problems you solve, the more familiar you'll
        become with Linux tools, commands, and system concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's highly recommended to revisit this list multiple times to
        improve your understanding. By the second attempt, you will uncover
        new tricks, while by the third attempt, you should find your code
        more efficient and refined.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, remember that simply memorizing solutions won't make you
        proficient. The true value comes from solving these problems on
        your own. Deliberate practice involves discovering solutions,
        experimenting with different approaches, and gaining deep insights
        into how Linux works under the hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep pushing yourself, and youâ€™ll find that the more you practice,
        the more natural it will feel when applying these concepts to real-world scenarios.
